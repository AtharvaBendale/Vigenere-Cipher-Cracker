# Vigenère-Cipher-Cracker
This is my repository for the **Vigenère Cipher Breaker** project made using python3 and based on **Friedman Test** and **Chi-Squared Statistic** method.
<br>
The file ```script.py``` takes ciphertext as input and outputs the decrypted text and the keyword found during the process. <br> <br> <br>

Plaintext:
it came from the world’s first computer – the mark 1 – a room-size maze of electromechanical circuits built in 1944 in a lab at harvard university. the computer developed a glitch one day, and no one was able to locate the cause. after hours of searching, a lab assistant finally spotted the problem. it seemed a moth had landed on one of the computer’s circuit boards and shorted it out. from that moment on, computer glitches were referred to as bugs.
